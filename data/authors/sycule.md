As a passionate advocate for cloud computing, I specialize in empowering businesses to leverage the transformative power of the cloud to accelerate growth and increase efficiency. With extensive experience in cloud solutions, I have successfully supported over 100 SMEs, enterprises, and startups in their cloud journeys, helping them harness the full potential of cloud technologies.

In my 7+ years of experience in IT industry, I took part of building up new markets, managing new team and developing new solutions to sell. I have strategically grown, organized, and led a dedicated sales team focused on cloud products and solutions.

Notable highlights of my career have been (1) my instrumental role in onboarding FPT Telecom as the Only One Focused Distributor of Cloudflare in Indochina. This achievement not only expanded our market reach but also reinforced our position as a leader in cloud security distribution. (2) My team's efforts are tailored to meet diverse client needs and deliver customized, high-impact solutions with 40%+ YoY growth, from 200K to 4M in ACV within 2.5 years. (3) Building up a tech community of 30K members within 4 years!

I am committed to continuing my journey of enabling companies to realize their vision through innovative cloud solutions, and am always eager to connect with like-minded professionals and organizations looking to transform their operations.
